# About this directory

*By Jan*:
I used to create clean directories to sort out the graphs and data for a publication - this is what this is. The structure is simple enough - some directories with the following contents:

| Directory   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *data*        | All data that is needed to create a plot ends up here. Every dataset gets an own directory - please try to keep it logical                                                                                    |
| *scripts*     | Containes all the code snippets to create the plots                                                                                                                                                           |
| *figures_raw* | Contains the raw plots as created by the scripts - usually I adjust these plots with inkscape afterwards (reorder, change certain labels etc.) - please prefix each file with the corresponding figure number |
| *figures*     | Contains the final figures as they appear in the manuscript - please prefix with the corresponding figure number in the manuscript                                                                            |
| *tables*      | Contains all the tables that appear in the manuscript, prefix with table number from the manuscript                                                                                                           |
| *supData*     | Contains all the supplementary data that appear in the manuscript, prefix with DatS+number from the manuscript                                                                                                |
| *submission*  | Contains all final documents (usually PDF) which will be uploaded during the submission process - so the final version                                                                                        |

Depending on the review process, there will be revision directories for each re-submission.

I hope this all makes sense - if not reach out
